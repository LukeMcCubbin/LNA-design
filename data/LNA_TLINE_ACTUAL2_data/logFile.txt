Warning detected by hpeesofsim in LinearCollapse '_2_' during analysis.
    LinearCollapse is disabled because there is 'DC' analysis present.

Pt DC convergence is used.

SP SP1[1] <Workspace2_lib:LNA_TLINE_ACTUAL2:schematic>   freq=(10 MHz->10 GHz)
Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis 'SP1'.
    UserValue(5.178047) > MaxRecommendValue(5.000000) for 'Wlargest/Wsmallest' in `Tee2'


Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The global circuit temperature (25 C or 298.15 K) does not equal the
    IEEE standard noise temperature (16.85 C or 290 K) in the noise
    analysis `SP1'. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio loss at the
    the circuit temperature and the noise figure, defined and calculated
    at the standard noise temperature, might not agree for a passive
    circuit. To eliminate this possible discrepancy, set the Temp parameter
    on the Options item to 16.85 C.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    The DC (0 Hz) value has not been specified in the Touchstone file
    'C:/Users/luke_mccubbin1/Box/CurrentClasses/Spring25/RF2/00101553120084.S2P'.

Warning detected by hpeesofsim during SP analysis `SP1'.
    Data in the Touchstone file `C:/Users/luke_mccubbin1/Box/CurrentClasses/Spring25/RF2/00101553120084.S2P'
    does not cover the requested value of `freq'.
    Therefore, the required data was obtained by extrapolation.
